            <p>I was involved in the ambitious Pentlier Fridge Making project, which aimed to create a technologically advanced refrigerator called the Pentlier Fridge.

              I had a major role in the development of the Pentlier Fridge concept and worked closely with engineers, designers, and product managers to ensure its successful implementation.
              
              I was tasked with examining what users wanted, researching the market, and determining the important features and functions of the refrigerator. By analyzing data extensively, I was able to discover consumer preferences and trends, which guided the design choices and allowed us to customize the Pentlier Fridge to satisfy customer requirements.</p>

            <div class="topic">Garbage Clasification</div>
            <p>The Garbage Classification using Arduino project aimed to automatically sort various types of garbage to address waste management challenges. As a key team member, I contributed to designing the system, implementing sensors, and programming classification algorithms. The Arduino microcontroller, along with ultrasonic, color, and infrared sensors, detected garbage characteristics for accurate classification. Machine learning algorithms were employed to differentiate recyclables, organic waste, and non-recyclables. Actuators directed sorted items to the appropriate bins. We continuously improved accuracy through testing and adjustments. The user-friendly interface facilitated real-time monitoring and interaction. This project positively impacted waste management, promoting recycling and minimizing environmental harm. It was a rewarding experience utilizing Arduino, sensors, and machine learning to address this societal issue.</p>
